Current project only works on Windows system. Run solution file in windows_server folder and solution file in windows_client folder to start the game. The rest players can be connected using telnet. 

To run the project in Mac platform, some new dependencies need to be installed in server side but the overall source file should be the same and should be able to compile and run as well. Mac version doesn't have stack terrain functionality due to the limitation of SDL library.
